      <h3>Healthy Snacks</h3>
      <p>
        Consider having a small, nutritious snack if you have a long gap between
        breakfast and lunch. Opt for fruits, nuts, or yogurt. These snacks can
        help maintain energy levels throughout the morning and prevent
        overeating during later meals. They also provide essential vitamins,
        minerals, and fiber necessary for a balanced diet.
      </p>
      <h3>Quality Sleep</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure you get adequate sleep each night. Create a relaxing bedtime
        routine and maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Quality sleep is
        essential for physical and mental health, and it contributes
        significantly to your overall well-being and productivity throughout the
        day. Avoid screens and caffeine close to bedtime and aim for 7-9 hours
        of uninterrupted sleep.
      </p>
      <h3>Productive Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Prepare your workspace or to-do list the night before to kickstart a
        productive morning without feeling overwhelmed. A clutter-free and
        organized environment can help reduce stress levels and increase focus,
        allowing you to tackle tasks more efficiently. Additionally, ensure your
        workspace has proper lighting and is ergonomically set up to promote a
        comfortable and productive work atmosphere.
